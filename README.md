# TicTacToe
This Android app is a basic TicTacToe game. You can play against an AI opponent. It uses Jetpack Compose for the design and keeps track of the current player with Preferences Data Store. Note that it doesn't store the game's progress if you close the app mid-game.

## Features
- Human vs. AI gameplay.
- Minimalistic design with Jetpack Compose.
- Preferences Data Store for tracking the current player.
- Simple AI logic implemented using if statements.

## Screenshots
